\section{Objectives \& Goals}
\label{sec:objectives_and_goals}

In this section you should define the objectives you want to reach with your project. This should be connected with the \textit{research questions}.

Make sure that you mention the \textbf{research gap} you want to address and give a short overview of how you want to achieve that. Make sure to be precise and that you make clear how you are going to \textbf{evaluate} how well your creation works. The evaluation is a key point on which your proposal is judged.
