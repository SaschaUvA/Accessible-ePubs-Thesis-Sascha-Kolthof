The EPUB file format is an open-to-use file format with many accessibility perks. For people that have disabilities that impact their capacity to read, EPUBs work well with assistive technologies and it adapts dynamically to alterations such as font size and style changes. Unfortunately, many EPUBs do not adhere to the most recent guidelines put in place by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Current academia has not yet explored the possibility of automating the process of making EPUBs more accessible with regards to the WCAG. The goal of this proposed research is therefore to create an automated tool with the help of the Beautiful Soup 4 package in Python that reassembles the EPUB into an accessible structure. The performance with be evaluated with the Ace checker, developed by The Daisy Consortium.
